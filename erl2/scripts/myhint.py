#
#   The node handles the hint detection and the ARMOR requests.
#   It subscribes to the topic /oracle_hint, and receives all the hints detected by the robot
#   The hint is examined and only the well formed hints are advertised to the topic /good_hint.
#   The node is also the client for the sevice /oracle_solution as it asks for the winning ID and compares
#   it with the consistent ID from the ontology.
#   It also conscronizes the communication with the rosplane interfaces, returning booleans as result for the
#   rosplan actions.
